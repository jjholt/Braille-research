            Braille provides an invaluable tactile reading system for the visually impaired. However, current braille keyboards and technology are external mechanical devices limited by their large form factor, high expense and long refresh rates. A magnetic touchpad in which braille dots are formed through a ferrofluid medium is a potential device that could promise to replace current braille technology by providing higher refresh rates, lower cost and give easy integration into current devices. In this report, work is shown towards developing a proof of concept magnetic braille touch pad, wherein a braille dot is formed using a ferrofluid by a controlled magnetic field produced by a small scale electromagnet. Attempted optimisation of braille dot formation is also undertaken, varying ferrofluid properties and electromagnet architecture to form accurate braille dots. Results show that magnetic braille touch pads are realistic devices that can be built and that there are clearly extensive opportunities for further research. In the future magnetic braille touch pads could be fully implemented into information technology devices for use by the visually impaired.},

An electrothermally controlled microactuator that exploits the hydraulic pressure due to the volumetric expansion of melted paraffin wax is described. The paraffin wax is contained within a bulk micromachined silicon container. The container is sealed using an elastic diaphragm of silicone rubber. The container is heated using gold microheaters located on an underlying glass substrate. All the layers used to make up the containers are bonded together using an overglaze paste. The complete 3/spl times/2 dot Braille cell has air gaps between containers, to prevent unwanted actuation by means of heat leakage from adjacent containers. The prototype Braille cell measures 7/spl times/8.5/spl times/2 mm/sup 3/ and its raised dots are held in equilibrium by pulsed actuation voltages. To maintain a dot height at 50\% of its maximum, a duty factor of more than 0.8 was found, with an average power of 0.30 W (PRF=0.027 Hz). The total actuation time for a dot on an up/down cycle was /spl sim/50 s. The dot height increases with an increasing duty factor with a fixed PRF, and increases with decreasing PRF with a fixed duty factor. A stable maximum dot height was achieved by reducing the cooling time.},

We present a simple model of pressure-controlled flow valves, which are analogous to electric transistors. The model is used to highlight the design of a valve that achieves hysteresis (noise immunity) and pressure-gain (signal propagation), both critical goals for creating fluidic logic circuits. Empirical results from a family of valves fabricated with graded design parameters and assembled in a logical NOT gate configuration back up the model. A pressure-gain of up to 26 kPa is achieved for a 80 kPa pressure supply, enabling the output of any logic gate to serve as the input of another in a sequential logic operation. Using the pressure-gain valves, we successfully built a latching memory unit that can be integrated with a pneumatic actuator capable of driving a braille pin. The design is sufficiently scalable and manufacturable to support the realization of a large dense array of pins at braille spacing.},

	abstract = {The increased access to books afforded to blind people via e-publishing has given them long-sought independence for both recreational and educational reading. In most cases, blind readers access materials using speech output. For some content such as highly technical texts, music, and graphics, speech is not an appropriate access modality as it does not promote deep understanding. Therefore blind braille readers often prefer electronic braille displays. But, these are prohibitively expensive. The search is on, therefore, for a low-cost refreshable display that would go beyond current technologies and deliver graphical content as well as text. And many solutions have been proposed, some of which reduce costs by restricting the number of characters that can be displayed, even down to a single braille cell. In this paper, we demonstrate that restricting tactile cues during braille reading leads to poorer performance in a letter recognition task. In particular, we show that lack of sliding contact between the fingertip and the braille reading surface results in more errors and that the number of errors increases as a function of presentation speed. These findings suggest that single cell displays which do not incorporate sliding contact are likely to be less effective for braille reading.},

For what concerns the access to written information, one of the main tools used by blind people is the traditional Braille code. This is the reason why in the recent years, there has been a technological effort to develop refreshable Braille devices. These consist of multiple physical dots that dynamically change their configuration to reproduce different sequences of the letters in Braille code. Although promising, these approaches have many drawbacks, which are mainly related to costs, design complexity, portability, and power consumption. Of note, while many solutions have been proposed for multi-cell devices, the investigation of the potentialities of single-cell refreshable systems has received little attention so far. This investigation could offer effective and viable manners to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks, likely fostering a widespread adoption of such assistive technologies with end-users. In this article, we present the design and characterization of a new cost-effective single-cell Electromagnetic Refreshable Braille Display, the Readable system. We also report on tests performed with blindfolded and blind expert Braille code readers. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our device in correctly reproducing alphanumeric content, opening promising perspectives in every-day life applications.},

This advanced method promises to be the next generation Braille book that is refreshable, flexible, and portable. Therefore, a safe dielectric elastomer Braille device actuated by a triboelectric nanogenerator is designed. It is easy to fabricate, inexpensive, and safe without any potential hazard for blind people. For triboelectric nanogenerators, the friction between two thin films can generate a voltage over 3 kV with a current of just 2 µA to deliver a shape change of the dielectric elastomer membrane. In the meantime, with the support of the pressor air in the chamber, the membrane will be raised up to be a touchable Braille dot. In addition, a programmed switch matrix is designed to control the Braille device with multiple dielectric elastomer dots to realize complicated refreshable display, providing a possibility of a page-size and portable braille e-book for the blind in the near future.},

	abstract = {We propose an electromagnetic-based braille display that can represent two-dimensional information. The key principle is a flip-latch structure, which allows satisfying requirements of both protrusion force for braille recognition and low power consumption. A magnet-inserted flip-latch has an eccentric shape, and is driven by and flips over the protruded voice coil and pushing the braille pin. Then it acts as a latch to lock and maintain the pin protrusion without additional energy consumption. We manufacture braille display modules and arrange them into a braille display with a total of 192 pins (16 columns and 12 rows). The pin-to-pin spacing is 2.5 mm, and the thickness of the display is about 5.5 mm. Each pin can switch states in 5 ms of operating time with 1W of power. In this paper, we describe the design and operating mechanism of the proposed actuator and perform operation tests to obtain stable driving conditions for the display. Finally, applications and limitations of the proposed braille display are analyzed.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the design and first prototype of the TactoBook system, a novel concept of reading assistive device that aims to make eBooks accessible to the blind. The TactoBook consists of a computer-based software translator that converts fast and automatically any eBook into Braille. The Braille version of the eBook is then encrypted as a file and stored in a USB memory drive which is later inserted and reproduced in a compact, lightweight, and highly-portable tactile terminal. Braille readers can store multiple eBooks in the same USB and access/reproduce them in the tactile terminal without this being plugged to a computer. The first Braille terminal developed is a 10-cell prototype based on a piezoelectric ultrasonic actuation approach. Its overall performance is quite similar to the one obtained with traditional Braille terminals. However, unlike them, the full device is only 1 kg mass and its compact dimensions (20 × 15 × 10 cm) make it easily carried by the user. A technical overview of all subsystems is presented and discussed.},
