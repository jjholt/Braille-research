abstract = {Visual impairments limit a person's ability to process information such as obstacles, environments, reading and especially multimedia content (e.g., photographs and videos). In this work, we present the design and operating mechanism of Braille PolyPad, a prototype 2D refreshable braille display featuring 4x10 braille cells, enabling the transformation of images to 2D braille information. The Braille Polypad is based on a miniature pump enabled pneumatic actuation of Braille pins. The encoder transformed the pattern information to a heating circuits to trigger the softening of a stiffness variable polymer, allowing for large pneumatic actuation in the softened pin area. The braille pattern can switch on and off in 0.5s each regardless of the number of braille cells and pins, with low operation voltage and low power consumption. The technical features in this work could enable low-cost, large-size matrix refreshable braille displays in compact form factor. Full development of the prototype device is still ongoing, including materials optimization, actuation uniformity, and improvement of user-friendly control interface.},

abstract = {We propose an electromagnetic-based braille display that can represent two-dimensional information. The key principle is a flip-latch structure, which allows satisfying requirements of both protrusion force for braille recognition and low power consumption. A magnet-inserted flip-latch has an eccentric shape, and is driven by and flips over the protruded voice coil and pushing the braille pin. Then it acts as a latch to lock and maintain the pin protrusion without additional energy consumption. We manufacture braille display modules and arrange them into a braille display with a total of 192 pins (16 columns and 12 rows). The pin-to-pin spacing is 2.5 mm, and the thickness of the display is about 5.5 mm. Each pin can switch states in 5 ms of operating time with 1W of power. In this paper, we describe the design and operating mechanism of the proposed actuator and perform operation tests to obtain stable driving conditions for the display. Finally, applications and limitations of the proposed braille display are analyzed.},
