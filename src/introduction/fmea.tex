\section{Failure mode and effects analysis}
VirtualEyes has used failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) to assess any potential problems that will arise whilst building the device and problems with the device's parts. We have therefore split our analysis into two sections: Process and Parts. 
The analysis of the parts of the device showed there are several potential hazards ranging from faulty batteries with a score of 64 to
