Most of the braille display products available in the market right now, such as those sold by HumanWare and RNIB, are based on piezoelectric bimorph benders or relay-lever mechanisms.  

The biomorph benders mechanism, shown in figure \ref{fig:piezo-bender} produces vibrations that move the pin up and down when placed in an electric field.
In relay-lever mechanisms, shown in figure \ref{fig:piezo-relay}, when voltage is supplied, the relay pushes the pin up. When the power is off, the weight of the lever mechanism moves the pin downwards to its original position. \cite{hernandez_characterization_2009}.

\todo[inline]{This moves from describing mechanism to condemning it. Requires information on what makes it burdensome, what is the cost and/or more concrete disadvantage why it's excluded.}
The main drawback of these two popular mechanisms is that benders and relay-lever systems are implemented as an additional burdensome module attached to the contact pins that may compromise integration capacity. In consequence, Braille displays are not usually portable. Besides, the common cost for a single piezoelectric cell s about 100 US dollars to the end user, setting the price of even single line RBD well over 1000 dollars. The small size of the market also lead to a vicious cycle and limit the price from going down.

Another recently developed mechanism is piezoelectric ultrasonic motor \cite{hernandez_characterization_2009}.
The ultrasonic linear motor consists of a shaft, a mobile element or slider, and a piezoelectric ceramic disk as shown in figure \ref{fig:piezo-miniature}.
The key advantage of this design is the ultra-light weight of this miniature motor.
However, the need for several layers, as shown in figure \ref{fig:piezo-full-design}, does not befit the density required by a 2D tactile display.
